    "text": "Most published research findings are false (Ioannidis 2005). Unfortunately, the main reason isn’t a few “bad apples” engaging in p-hacking, data fabrication, or other fraudulent practices. Rather, it is due to a form of statistical blindness; specifically, the mechanical application of frequentist methods like significance testing simply because they are the industry standard.\nSince the early 2010s, we have indeed witnessed a massive issue known as the Replication Crisis. Many cornerstone studies, ranging from the social sciences to medicine, failed to replicate because they all followed the same rigid rules of statistical testing. Yet, we seem to keep applying temporary patches, such as lowering the acceptance threshold for p-values to 0.01.\nSo, I decided to save the world (as every PhD student attempts to do) or die trying (which, in this context, just means publishing a few papers). Bernoulli’s Fallacy by Aubrey Clayton (2021) greatly helped me put the pieces together. This blog documents my journey of following the Clayton’s steps, re-learning probability, running simulations, and building applets, along with some personal reflections.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nClayton, Aubrey. 2021.
