Learning is difficult, and it doesn't get easier. The only thing you realize is that the previous arduous steps seem surprisingly trivial in retrospect.
This amazes me. It is like a paradox, the strenuous effort itself is painful and not immediately rewarding. You just remember the hardship as "huh, how hard this thing was before that I'm doing now as if nothing".
To keep learning and improving, you must have this awareness all the time, otherwise it's just the feeling of difficulty.

This way of thinking lead me to understand that it is *possible*. When you encounter something new (a new topic or a skill), if it is very foreign to you, it may feel like it is impossible to comprehend or to achieve. 
But that is the only way. If it is difficult, I'm in the correct route. It may sound so trivial when I put it this way but we often miss how learning works and don't recognize it when we avoid this hard effort.
I remember when I meet with this peculiar exam for a pilot training program called DLR test. At first, I said this is just not possible for me. But day by day, improving incrementally, I passed it in the first try 
(later I gave up on this and thankfully not became a commercial pilot).

I played video games since I was a kid. If you'd remember, games were more fun and they were objectively more difficult.
I remember that I was grinding and pushing and keep trying when I was playing. It was just part of it. I remember that I was teaching techniques to neighbor's kids older than me to pass a certain level in some game in Atari.
Despite this childhood experience, I was struck with this famous indie game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. I said this is ridiculously hard, why do the developers torture me? I even thought some parts are just impossible for me to complete.
But then, day by day you keep getting better and improve your skills. I’m amazed how parts that once made me want to throw the controller have now become so easy, only with my improvements in skills.
There is the predominant advice in such games among the community: "git gud".

I am not the most athletic type, maybe partly because of too much exercise in video games in my developing years and not so much in the sports.
But tremendous news, it doesn't matter too much if your goal is not become a pro. Even if you feel like inherently you are not good at something, or lack of some prior experience or talent, it is perfectly doable.
I try to find things that are difficult and know that this is not only a good but the necessary indicator. At first, it was so painful to push myself in road cycling, but now I easily do a 100km in a day.

What's next is math. I’ve always felt inadequate. So my goal is to reach the proficiency level of a math undergrad to have what it takes to confidently discuss probability and statistics.
It feels so difficult even now that it's holding me back from starting. But let's never ever forget that it is the only way to "git gud".
