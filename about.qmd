This blog is a journal for my learning journey in this pivotal field of Probability.
It is one of the main pillars of scientific logic, yet no consensus has been reached about what it actually is. 
Furthermore, when I say it is *one of the main pillars*, I am taking the safest stance, though it is famously argued that probability is, in fact, *the* logic of science [@jaynes2003probability].
